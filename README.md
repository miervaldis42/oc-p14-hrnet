## 🚀 Run the Project

1. Clone the repo from this link : [P14 repo](https://github.com/miervaldis42/oc-p14-hrnet)
2. In a terminal, run `npm i`, then `npm run build` and finally, `npm start`

🎉 **_Congrats ! The website is up and running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in production mode !_**

## 🐛 Testings

To trigger the testing process in this project, do the following :

1. In a terminal, place yourself in the project with `cd ./`
2. Install the project dependencies with `npm i`
3. Then, run the **_unit testing_** with either `npm run test` or `npm test`, so Vitest will trigger the unit testings
4. And run the **_e2e testing_** with `npm run test:e2e` command and Playwright will open the project in a browser test and then, run the project on several platforms _(mobile, desktop & on different browsers)_

🎉 **_Congrats ! The project has been tested !!_**
